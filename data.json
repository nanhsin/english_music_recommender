Could tell by the laces, they tight\nOr are you only focused on the steps that I'm taking in life?\nAnd then you got the ones who claim a guy that's everyone's nigga\nLeave for a month to Colombia and now everything bigger\nEven your attitude is bigger, your appetite growing\nYour nigga is not even a starting QB\nThat nigga on the field before the game, he just practicin' throwing\nWhat happened to sellin' real estate? Where all that shit was goin'?\nAll your fuckin' captions lately talkin' 'bout happy and glowin'\nAll of that snappin' and posin'\nWhole time, he jealous of your past, who the fuck was your last?\nAskin' questions 'bout niggas, and you get slapped in the face if you happen to know him\nDomestic abuse, that man is not a man for you, he's a pathetic excuse\nLyin' through your teeth, scared of lettin' your skeletons loose\nBut you stick around, 'cause who's out there that's better for you?\nPlus \nhe paid the surgeon so your ass could get a caboose\nBut he wants you covering it up, so your dresses is loose\nPlus it's the only thing they see when you get introduced\nNow you on a flight to Bogot\u00e1 just to get it reduced\n, good Lord\nMore weeks of recovery clinics, front like you love every minute\nYou gettin' pushed to the brink, you sittin' at double your limit\nMeanwhile, that nigga out in my city fuckin' on bitches\nIf they even mention me and showin' me love, then it's finished\nJealous-ass niggas\nDamn\nThen you got the ones that travel 'cross the globe\nEverything is paid, they don't need a man\nDon't listen to Drake, never been a fan\nYou got a million hoes, yeah, I understand\nI'm never fuckin' you, so take that out your plans\nI'm good on all you niggas 'til a ring is on my hand\nThen I search your name, find you on the 'Gram\nClick the Linktree and see you suckin' dick on cam, what the fuck?",

Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down\nIf I had to choose, I would say right now\n[Chorus]\nI wanna get him back\nI wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad\nOh, I wanna get him back\n'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad\nOh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again\nI want to get him back, back, back",
